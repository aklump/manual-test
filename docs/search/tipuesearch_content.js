It's for those situations where automated testing is forthcoming, would not be feasible.  It's meant to be a very quick and simple way to have QA.  Visit https:\/\/aklump.github.io\/manual_test for full documentation.  Quick Start  This one-liner will create a folder called tests_manual and install this library there using composer.  mkdir tests_manual &amp;&amp; cd tests_manual &amp;&amp; composer require --dev aklump\/manual-test &amp;&amp; cp .\/vendor\/aklump\/manual-test\/examples\/config.xml .    Modify tests_manual\/config.xml as necessary Create at least one folder, with a manual test. Relative paths are relative to the config file. export TEST_BASE_URL=http:\/\/mysite.com; .\/vendor\/bin\/generate --configuration=config.xml You can also do like this: export SIMPLETEST_BASE_URL=http:\/\/mysite.com; .\/vendor\/bin\/generate --configuration=coanfig.xml   Contributing  If you find this project useful... please consider making a donation.

For example if you wanted to link to the admin page of the site under test use something like one of these; notice the leading forward slash.  &lt;\/admin&gt; [Admin page](\/admin)    Tokens  The following tokens may be used in your test cases:  {{ website.pretty }} {{ website.link }} {{ website.url }}   File Structure  \u2514\u2500\u2500 auto_retina     \u251c\u2500\u2500 admin.md     \u251c\u2500\u2500 image_quality.md     \u251c\u2500\u2500 images     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 js-1.jpg     \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 js-2.jpg     \u2514\u2500\u2500 js.md    Test files should be named to match their id, e.g. admin.md, image_quality.md, js.md. Test Scenarios should be created one to a file. The directory that contains test scenarios will be used to define it's group. Group directory names should be lower-case, underscore named, e.g., auto_retina.  (You may also provide a group name in the frontmatter to override the directory name). Each group directory should contain an images directory. Image names should match the test scenario following by an incremental number, e.g. js-1.jpg, js-2.jpg.   Parts of a Test File  Test files are markdown files with yaml frontmatter.  Certain level two headers have specific and defined meanings, with special rendering; these are described below.  The design is meant to make writing tests super fast and easy using familiar patterns.  Frontmatter  Here is an example frontmatter with the required fields.  Optional fields are explained below.  --- Test Case ID: admin Author: Aaron Klump Created: February 27, 2019 Duration: 8 minutes ---   Test Case Id   Should be lower-cased, and hyphenated. Short and unique across tests. The first component should reflect the group, e.g. first initial(s).   Author  You should enter the name of the author of this test.  Created  This must be a parseable date, e.g., February 27, 2019  Duration  The estimated time to complete this test.  It should be something like 8 min or 8 minutes.  This is optional.  Test Suite  This will be detected from the configuration XML.  You may also override an auto-detection using this front matter:  Test Suite: All   Group  The group is determined automatically based on the name of the directory containing the test case file.  You may override this using frontmatter.  Group: Auto Retina   Test Scenario      ## Test Scenario      The admin form loads and saves new info as expected.         Pre-Conditions   Imperative statements telling the tester what to do before the test begins, so that the test can be performed.  ## Pre-Conditions  1. Make sure [Image Style Quality module](https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/project\/image_style_quality) is uninstalled. 1. Log in with proper permissions.    Test Data   Test Data must follow an h2 header called Test Data. Test data should be entered as YAML in a markdown code block. Nothing else should be entered in this section. These are available to be used as tokens, e.g. in your Test steps (see below) You can have \"hidden\" test data, which will not render, but can be used as tokens, by starting the token name with an underscore.  ## Test Data      First name: your first name     Last name: your last name     Email: a valid email you have access to     _Hidden Token: 50%    Tokens  Just like Test Data, except this section will not be rendered.  Use this section to define tokens.  ## Tokens      Final size: large     Color: blue   Test Execution   Imperative statements telling the tester what to do from start to finish. Indent assertion(s) as a child list as seen below. Use Test Data tokens as necessary  ## Test Execution  1. Enter {{ First name }} into the form. 1. Enter {{ Last name }} into the form. 1. Submit form.   - The next page says _Hello {{ First name }} {{ Last name }}_. 1. Return to the previous page.   - Assert First name is not empty.   - Assert Last name is not empty.
